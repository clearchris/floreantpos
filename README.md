# FloreantPOS

Java Retail and Restaurant Point of Sale System

Forked from https://github.com/fat-tire/floreantpos because of the svn corruption fat-tire mentions in his 2-16-18 update.  Fat-tire has also made a [swing web app](https://fat-tire.github.io/floreantpos.html) for floreant, and also an [android app](https://www.github.com/fat-tire/hippos) to access the web app.  Finally, he has also written some [deployment scripts](https://github.com/fat-tire/floreantpos_updater).
